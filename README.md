# BlueBot - A Java-written Discord bot

**Official support server :** [<img src="https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/268853008455041025/widget.png?style=shield">](https://discord.gg/rSekkJv)

You can also contact me on **Steam**, but please write a comment before adding me : [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Steam-Bluered Mind-blue.svg">](http://steamcommunity.com/id/blueredmind)

You can add the bot to your server by clicking on [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=268420199370194944&scope=bot&permissions=-1).

The **API** can be found [here](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA).
However, the required dependancies for the bot are included in this repository.

**BlueBot** will provide useful features like :
* Moderation
* Music/various sounds player
* Meme search
* More to come !

## Getting started

If you want a .exe (or something like that) to run, I currently only run the bot through my IDE (currently IntelliJIdea), I'll provide later information on how to use the bot as a standalone.

If you want to use it at the moment, you'll need an IDE.
You also will have to create your onw app [here](https://discordapp.com/login?redirect_to=/developers/applications/me).

Simply **clone the project** into your favorite IDE using GitHub's integration. 
On your application's page, **get your bot's token and give it to the program as an argument** in Run configuration. If no parameter is given, the bot won't start.

## Commands

There are currently four commands available : ```!ping```, ```!say```, ```!sayhi```, ```!rate```
A lot more of commands will be added in the future, and the ```!help``` command will be used to display them all.

By typing ```help``` after each command, you'll get information on how to use the command. 

**Example :** by typing ```!ping help``` you'll get the following response : 
```
The command ping pings the bot (to check if it's online). Usage : !ping
```

# Also !

I'm currently a student, so the project may take a while to come to its end. Don't expect too many updates, I have some work to do and some social life to have.


And I like blue, obviously.
